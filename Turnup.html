                    top of that, Freelancer-EU wants to build a community site TurnUp, where freelancers and employers
                    can connect, learn and share their experiences.

                    world's largest and most influential firms, including Airbnb, Amazon, Walmart, Google, and Apple,
                    are widely considered to be partnering with freelancers. Following their example, more companies
                    around the world are refusing to limit themselves to the candidates' local pool and go looking for
                    the talent they need overseas. A global market for freelancing services is an online platform where
                    companies can discover and employ independent free-lancers to do some remote work.
                    <br><br>
                    I worked on Freelancer-EU as a lead product designer when it was just a small team of the founder,
                    and a junior designer. I led the product, marketing, UX and UI strategy for the team. I’ve been
                    extremely fortunate to have been part of this journey and have grown tremendously during this time.
                    Some key achievements listed below :
                    <br><br>
                    Turned an idea into a product. The ability to transform an idea into something much more tangible is
                    a process that is both exhilarating and rewarding. I worked closely with the founder and team to
                    shape the product vision and strategy of Freelancer. While the product is still in development and
                    has not yet been released to the public, being able to see how much they have grown as a team and
                    startup is truly sensational.
                    <br><br>
                    Juggled many different hats. Working in an early-stage startup is not easy. I dedicated hours of my
                    spare time and weekends conducting research, sketching, testing and designing the product alongside
                    coordinating events, writing video scripts, creating pitch deck presentations and filling out grant
                    applications for the business and marketing side of the business.igner

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Having done some
                    freelance work myself, I understood the pains of not being able to land clients due to lack of
                    networking, and not knowing the right people. I wanted to validate these problems with peers, so i
                    took the initiative to run focus groups sessions with friends and other people in the business that
                    were equally frustrated. After having some conversations we discovered the top frustrations:

                        Maintaining a continuous flow of
                        work is one of the biggest concerns. This is due to many freelancers not having a large enough
                        network and not knowing how to market themselves.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Finding freelancers.</span> As
                        needs for talented workers grow,
                        it can be a challenge to find the right people to work on your product.

                            contracts.</span> Working with
                        clients from all over the world means figuring out payment methods and filling out the right
                        contracts, which change frequently and from country to country.

                            project.</span> Employers must have some degree of trust that the freelancer is going to
                        deliver on their promises and the freelancer must trust that the employer is going to pay on
                        time.

                    flawless collaboration, after the workshops hardly any revisions were required, neither in
                    information architecture nor in visual design. As a learning: Make sure to really really get the
                    expectations of the group right and to clearly communicate the exact goal of the individual
                    exercises – I thought I did so, but I felt a lack of understanding here and there.

                        In a startup, there is only so much time and effort that you can invest so it's important to
                        focus on the features that can deliver the highest value for your users.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Don't worry too much about the
                            detail.</span> Earlier in my journey, I made the mistake of worrying about the look of the
                        UI. Taking a step back and reassessing the user flows helped me to re-prioritize the UX.

                    <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Focus on the problem.</span> HAt
                        the end of the day, it is your users pains that you will be solving for so keeping that front of
                        mind is important as it's easy to lose sight of this when you're bogged down in the day to day.
