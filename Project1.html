                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Electronic Data
                    Capture (EDC) is admittedly a fairly generic sounding term, but in the clinical trials
                    field it actually means something fairly specific: using systems to collect clinical trial data in
                    electronic form as opposed to paper form. This was the first and most important application we were
                    tasked with building.

                    The EDC is a critical component of modern clinical research, streamlining the data collection
                    process
                    and enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and data quality. They help researchers, sponsors, and
                    regulatory
                    authorities manage trial data effectively.

                    As such, one thing was clear from the beginning, this system would be utilized by multiple
                    stakeholders
                    involved in clinical research and trials. </div>

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">As a team of
                    initally 2
                    designers, we individually led the design on different projects. By working closely together, and
                    with
                    our product manager and engineers on the team, we were able to have a very open and collaborative
                    process.

                    I was a very strong advocate for integrating more user research throughout all stages of the design
                    process, resulting in:

                        <LI>A design requirements document (‘DRD’) that would be created before a project kick-off and
                            shared
                            with the team alongside the existing product requirements doc. The DRD gathered and grouped
                            user
                            research from all available sources and framed the core issues/needs within the overarching
                            jobs-to-be-done for the product. This document helped to bring the team onto the same page,
                            empathize with our users and align on priorities from a user experience perspective.</LI>

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Understanding the
                    requirements of clinical researchers, data managers, and end-users was foundational. The product and
                    design team conducted thorough research involving a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods,
                    including interviews, surveys, and observing user workflows.
                    <br><br>
                    It was essential to grasp the pain points, challenges, and specific needs of each user group.
                    Researchers would prioritize ease of data entry and access, while data managers would focus on data
                    integrity and system integrations. Gathering this comprehensive understanding helped in creating a
                    system that met diverse user needs.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Once user needs
                    were identified, the conceptualization phase began. This involved brainstorming sessions and
                    collaborative workshops to generate initial concepts and wireframes. Sketches and rough prototypes
                    helped visualize the system's structure and functionalities. While rapid prototypes aided in
                    creating clickable prototypes that allowed for early-stage testing and validation.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Having in mind
                    that this would be just the first application of many that we were going to be working on, it was
                    obvious that creating a <a style="color: #499DFF; text-decoration: underline;"
                        href="/Project1.html"> design system</a> early on was going to be very important in order to
                    ensure
                    visual and functional consistency across apps, efficiency, scalability, as well as ease of
                    maintainability and cross-team collaboration.
                    <br><br>
                    Creating a user-friendly interface was paramount, as researchers and data managers will spend
                    significant time interacting with the system. Iterative design refinements based on usability
                    testing and feedback sessions were conducted to fine-tune the interface. This involved surveys and
                    phone calls with clinical staff that validated some of our design and product assumptions.
                    <br><br>
                    After many iterations and rounds of user testing and phone calls to validate that we were making the
                    right changes, we launched in an internal Beta period to gather more feedback from our staff.
                    Post-launch, I followed up on the phone with many of the staff that had provided initial feedback,
                    and we also launched a feedback widget for users to provide feedback in-product.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Vial EDC was
                    released for production in January 2023, and has been used to efficiently in multiple trials since.
                    Since release we’ve added more than 20 new functionalities and improvements. Throughout the design
                    and development process, adherence to regulatory standards was paramount. Compliance with
                    regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and specific clinical trial guidelines ensured data privacy,
                    security, and integrity.
                    <br><br>
                    What I've shown above is just a small fraction of the project. We designed entire systems allowing
                    multiple user roles to enter patient data, edit, manage and interact with the data in many different
                    ways. Conducting training sessions and workshops to familiarize users with the system's
                    functionalities, data entry protocols, and best practices, enabling them to navigate the system
                    confidently. By meticulously following the design process steps and engaging stakeholders at every
                    phase, we managed to build an EDC system that delivers a robust, user-friendly, and compliant
                    platform for conducting clinical trials

                    Startup Platform was the next step towards enabling faster and more efficient trials for sponsors.
                    The Site Startup Platform would enable fast and self-service onboarding—entirely digitally for
                    clinical sites. By eliminating long email threads and archaic document transfer & approval
                    processes, we would simplify and accelerate site activation. The cloud-based site startup would
                    enable onboarding for sites in as few as 30 days, as opposed to 90+ days that it normally takes when
                    done manually.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">There is a lack
                    of a centralized platform for clinical sites to access and manage all outstanding tasks required to
                    run a trial / study. Sites receive DocuSigns, fillable PDFs, Excel budgets, and requests for
                    documents, all via email. At any given time, sites are dealing with multiple different trial start
                    ups and requests for information, with no visibility into completion status.
                    <br><br>
                    The current process involves manual tracking of outstanding tasks across multiple platforms
                    (multiple monday boards, email, eTMF) leading to delays in site activation and sponsor timelines.
                    <br><br>
                    The goal is to provide a unified portal to track individual site onboarding progress, and enable
                    sites to view all outstanding tasks required of them.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">In the field of
                    clinical research operations, effective communication and collaboration between sites and Contract
                    Research Organizations (CROs) (Vial) is crucial for the success of a study. This time we were
                    exploring the implementation of a communication and documentation portal to replace email-based
                    transactional communications. The goal is to centralize key study communications, documents,
                    milestones, and metrics, while also providing additional features to enhance collaboration and
                    efficiency.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">The proposed
                    solution involves the development and implementation of a communication and information portal for
                    sites. The portal will serve as a centralized hub for study-related information and facilitate
                    seamless interactions between sites and Vial.

                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Quick Access to Trial management apps:</span> The portal will
                        provide links to essential resources,
                        such as the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, vendor portals (e.g., 4G, Lab Portal), and
                        Egnyte file storage.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Study KPIs Tracking:</span> The portal will feature a dashboard
                        displaying study KPIs derived from the
                        EDC system and Monday boards. Examples of tracked metrics include subject status chart, upcoming
                        visits, missed visits count, new query count, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Ongoing Study Tasks:</span> A dedicated section within the
                        portal will resemble the Site Startup Portal
                        task list. Sites will receive notifications for new tasks, such as uploading updated
                        certificates or submitting specific documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Storage for Study Documents:</span> The portal will include file
                        views to provide sites with up-to-date
                        study documents, including protocols, guidance documents, and other relevant files.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Notification Center:</span> The portal will incorporate a
                        site-specific and study-wide notification
                        center. Sites will receive notifications regarding upcoming milestones, database lock dates,
                        monitoring visits, and other important study events. For example, before a monitoring visit, the
                        site will be prompted to review specific documents.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">Clinical Research
                    Associates (CRAs) play a pivotal role in clinical trials. They act as liaisons between the sponsor
                    company and the trial sites conducting the study. Their primary responsibilities include Site
                    Monitoring and Data Verification. CRAs currently rely on manual processes/personal todo lists to
                    manage visits, write reports and follow up on action items. By creating a Monitoring Portal that is
                    integrated with the Electronic Data Capture System (that contains patient data), we would enable
                    CRAs to spend a lot less hours on visit preparation and closure, leading to more efficiently
                    conducted monitoring visits.

                    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Lack of interoperability:</span> System doesn't work well with
                        other trial systems (EDC, eTMF, IRT), causing data duplication and admin burden.
                    </li>

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; max-width: 950px;">The solution
                    proposed by the design team was an integrated system, allowing CRAs to set up and keep track of
                    monitoring visits, and create all the necessary reports, where they would be able to keep track of
                    what data they need to verify, outstanding action items, follow up items, as well as allow
                    collaboration between users.
                    <br><br>
                    Keeping a consistent visual design to the Electronic Data Capture system was crucial in designing
                    the system as users would be expected to switch between the two quite frequently during their
                    visits, so a sense of familiarity with how the system works would be most useful. Another reason for
                    this was to enable the development team to work faster, by reusing elements from other Vial
                    platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    The system is currently in development and is expected to be launched in Q1 of 2024.
